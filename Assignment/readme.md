# Quin Assignment Status

Task 1 - Only 90% is completed and to complete the rest, we need the APIs for sure. The problem here is that the friends are in local storage, not in the DB. Hence, we can't add them to trips.

Task 2 - Completed. Now the app will display the directions from the current location to the destination i.e., the selected city.

You can find the updated apk here itself in the same folder. Please check it once.

The following ones are the screenshots of the five screens that are involved in the above mentioned tasks.
